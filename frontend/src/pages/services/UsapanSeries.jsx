        <h3>3. Usapan ng mga Kabataan (Talk for the Youth)</h3>

          <li><strong>STI and HIV Awareness:</strong> Educating the youth on the risks and prevention of sexually transmitted
            infections.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Key Objectives of the Program</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Informed Choice:</strong> To provide accurate, scientific information so that every Filipino can make
          an informed choice regarding their reproductive health.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Linkage:</strong> Unlike a standard seminar, Usapan sessions often conclude with a direct link
          to health service providers, allowing participants to access their chosen family planning method immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Utilizing health caravans or barangay assemblies to bring government
          services directly to the doorsteps of the people.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why is it Effective?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive Format:</strong> Uses a facilitated discussion style rather than a one-way lecture, allowing
          participants to ask questions and share personal concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>Culturally Sensitive:</strong> Sessions are conducted in local dialects and use relatable analogies to
          explain complex medical concepts.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Shifts the focus from population control to family well-being, emphasizing that
          planning a family is a pathway to a better quality of life.</li>
      </ul>
